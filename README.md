## Developer's message

Midvale records was made entirely from scratch as I learn the basics of web development from square one. This was an opportunity for me to explore the roles of full stack development as well learning the basics of databases, security, web frameworks such as Express.js. 

Since I've had no prior knowledge in web development at all since I've first started this project, I'm sure there are security holes, unconventional styling and documentation, and unnecessary/slow code throughout the repo. All of the CSS, HTML, JS has been done by me and I will continue to improve this website as I learn more about web development.

If you see any unsafe code, flaws, or would like to improve this website please contact me at nelsonquoc2003@gmail.com
